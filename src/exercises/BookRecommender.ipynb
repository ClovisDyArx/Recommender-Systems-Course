    "# The Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will implement a simple recommender system using the GoodRead dataset. The dataset contains information about books, authors, and user ratings. The goal is to recommend books to users based on their ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is available at this link: [GoodReads Dataset](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k/releases/download/v1.0/goodbooks-10k.zip). It contains the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `books.csv`: Contains information about books.\n",
    "- `ratings.csv`: Contains user ratings for books.\n",
    "- `book_tags.csv`: Contains tags assigned to books.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Task\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to implement a simple recommender system that recommends books to users based on their ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the dataset.\n",
    "2. Perfom data analysis.\n",
    "3. Justify all the choices you make as results of some data analysis.\n",
    "4. Implement the recommender system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "While implementing the recommender system, you need to perform the following tasks (that are also a guideline for the implementation).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load and explore the dataset.\n",
    "- Analyse the distribution of ratings.\n",
    "- Visualise the number of ratings per book and per user.\n",
    "- Check for missing values and decide how to handle them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encode User_ID and Book_Title as integer indices for the model.\n",
    "- Create a feature to represent the popularity of books based on the number of ratings.\n",
    "- Optionally, incorporate author information if it improves the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Building the Recommender System\n",
    "\n",
    "- Split the data into training and test sets.\n",
    "- Implement a collaborative filtering model using matrix factorization.\n",
    "- Train the model and evaluate its performance using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) on the test set.\n",
    "- Generate book recommendations for a set of users.- \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a function to display the top N recommended books for a given user.\n",
    "- Discuss how different features and the size of the dataset affect the model's performance."
